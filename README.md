I tought it is a fun puzzle to solve so I decided to give a shot. Here is my solution -in javascript.

`node getDump.js`

Parse raw data
`node parseDump.js`

You can change filenames and login details in `params.js`

======
Import `out.raw` with Audacity as raw data, Signed 32 bit, default endianness with a sample rate 4000Hz.
